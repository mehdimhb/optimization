## Implemented Methods

Explore a selection of implemented methods, including:
- Gradient Descent with constant, exact line search and backtracing step size
- Scaled Gradient Descent with Diagonal Reversed Hessian and Custom Matrix
- Newton's Method
- Damped Newton's Method
- Hybrid Gradient-Newton Method
